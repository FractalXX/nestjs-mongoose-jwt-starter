# NestJS Mongoose starter kit

A starter project to kickoff your NestJS API development.

## Technologies

- Database: MongoDB (with `Mongoose`)
- Authentication: `passport-local` (for login) and `passport-jwt`
- Swagger
- BCrypt (for encrypting passwords)

## Configuration

Configuration depends on environment variables. The following environment variables must be provided:

```[bash]
#Database connection
DATABASE_HOST
DATABASE_USER
DATABASE_PASSWORD
DATABASE_NAME

#Authentication
TOKEN_EXPIRATION_SECONDS
PASSWORD_SALT_ROUNDS
JWT_SECRET_KEY
```

## Logging

Basic logging is configured. Incoming requests and their responses get logged to the console.

There is also a `@Log(LogLevel)` decorator if you want to log the execution of methods.

## Running the project

Scripts are the default ones that come with the projects generated by the Nest CLI.
